# Compare
Compare is a Java webapp that can be deployed in an application container like Tomcat, or it can be debugged in embedded form using Jetty. What it does is compare two versions of a multi-version document and merge the differences into the markup for the text. It then returns a HTML string containing the merged markup+text+differences. It should be used in conjunction with the compare Drupal module, which displays the result in a two-way or three-way view.
